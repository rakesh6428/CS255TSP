# CS255TSP
Traveling Salesman Problem is that given a set of cities and the distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. To summarize, the problem is to find the shortest path go through each vertex once and then return back to start vertex in the graph and It can be seen as a minimum weight Hamiltonian Cycle problem. We are focused on solving the problem using 3 different approaches: Brute force, Dynamic Programming, Greedy. Later, we shall be analyzing the performance metric in terms of running time and space involved in the above-mentioned approaches.
